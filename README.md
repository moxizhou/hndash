## Usage

> Built off of Scheming-Lion, jetgrizzly uses the application to further enhance data visualization, aggregation, and real-time integration. 

## Our tech stack

> Our project uses Angular, Node, a MySql Database for the backend, and the Sequelize ORM.

## Navigating the file structure

* Client - all client facing code. Contains our primary features - Track Posts, track users, see user's top stories, word frequency visualizations.
* Server - contains (1) a set of query helper functions for easily using the Database (2) a database folder, which contains our code for inserting new data into our database, and (3) a generic server setup for local development (which you most likely will not use now that we have fully populated the database and have it deployed using Azure)
* Testing - We have some basic testing built out for the front-end code. The backend code is not rigorously tested because that would require read/write access to HN's own database, but we have tested this informally and have confirmed that all datapoints exist.

### Installing Dependencies

```sh
sudo npm install -g bower
